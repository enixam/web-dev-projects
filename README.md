### JavaScript Notebook 

An interactive notebook for JavaScript.

To use the app, run `npx javascript-notebook serve` and then navigate to https://localhost:3001

You can also install the package globally via

```

npm install -g javascript-notebook
# yarn
yarn global add javascript-notebook
```

For a quick preview, go to https://javascript-notebook.netlify.app/, where you can still code but not save to local files.

### Minimal Chatroom

A minimal online chatroom, including realtime updates, authentication, and security rules, uses Glassmorphism UI. It's also my first attempt at [Github Actions](https://github.com/enixam/chatroom/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Deploy+with+Firebase%22)!
